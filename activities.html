                <h2>There is Never a Dull Moment in London!</h2>
                <hr>
                <div id="splitContainer">
                    <div id="left">
                        <p>
                            There are many activities to come by in London. Whether it is theatrical, leisurely, in
                            nature, or sports, there are an abundance of options for you. To start with
                            <span>theatre</span>, London has many fantastic theatre programs. The most famous being the
                            <span>London National Theatre</span>, seen as the epicentre of London’s theatre scene. Other
                            theatres include the Royal Ballet and Opera, Shakespeare Globe, which allows you to go back
                            in time and see where the first ever Shakespeare plays were performed, and London Coliseum.
                            Many iconic plays take place in these, such as Les Miserables and The Phantom of the Opera.
                            Lastly, there are also more modern plays and shows like Harry Potter and the Cursed Child
                            and Frozen which I was able to see, and it was fantastic.

                            Going into more leisurely activities in London, there are many areas you can go to. If you
                            would like to <span>learn about the history</span> behind the United Kingdom, take a visit
                            to The British Museum or the Natural History Museum. I cannot recommend both of these
                            locations more, amazing art and even knight armor / crown jewels on display! If you want a
                            more unique experience, check out The Crystal Maze Experience. This awesome maze exists
                            based off of a 90’s TV show, where teams must solve challenges and compete against others.
                            Similar to that, there are many interactive and brain-challenging escape rooms like
                            Mission:Breakout, which was an absolute blast during my visit.

                        <p>Quickly touching on nature activities, you can find more on the <a class="connector"
                                href="./nature.html">Nature page here</a>, many recommendations go out to London’s Royal
                            Parks. Many locations like <span>Green Park</span> and Hyde Park show beautiful landscapes
                            and hiking trails, and even contain memorials. You can also go on a lovely canal ride on
                            Regent’s Canal, which passes the <span>London Zoo</span> and Camden Lock.
                            <br><br>
                            Lastly, London has an extremely busy and <span>competitive sports scene</span>. To quickly
                            remark some, London has cricket, rugby, and tennis all having decent sized leagues and big
                            fanbases. Yet, most popular, football / soccer is what rules the sport scene in London and
                            even the whole United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is home to an overwhelming number of
                            clubs, including Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, and many
                            many more. London is home to Arsenal, Millwall, West Ham, Chelsea, and a few more. Of course
                            this means there are many stadiums to travel to, and many games to watch. Football clubs are
                            a big part of the United Kingdom’s culture, which you can see more in depth on here.
                            Forewarning, different fan bases are very loyal to their teams, expect an earful if you are
                            wearing the wrong jersey or colors. The sports scene in London is vivid and full of exciting
                            games and fan bases. Overall, activities are all around you in this great city, it’s just up
                            to you to find what you like and do it. With all that there is to do in London, there is
                            truly never a dull moment.
