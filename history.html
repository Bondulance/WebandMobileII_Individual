                        <p>The history behind the United Kingdom is long and vast, going over centuries upon centuries
                            of time. We are going to start at the peak of action in the country, at the lovely time of
                            the Great British Empire. The British Empire was the largest ever colony of countries or
                            states at the time, that were all controlled by the United Kingdom. The Empire lasted from
                            the early 1500’s all the way to 1783 which we will touch on towards the end. The Empire
                            started when Scottland attempted to expand overseas. This brought attention to the King of
                            England at the time, and with trade from other countries, the Empire gained it’s first land.
                            This being the tiny islands Gibraltar and Menorca. These were quite important though, as
                            they would grant control to the Mediterrean.

                            Meanwhile, in the East Indies, (India today), the British had gained control of the Dutch
                            East India Company, turning it to the well known British East India Company. This gained the
                            Empire a overloading amount of money, processing tea and other goods. Keeping the theme of
                            overseas, the British Empire found success colonizing Africa. The countries that were
                            colonized were present day South Africa, Nigeria, Zambia, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Sudan, The
                            Gambia, Kenya, Ghana, Egypt, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Somalia. This was a harsh time
                            for the natives in this country, the Empire enslaved many and made them work at rubber
                            plantations and other harsh working conditioned jobs.

                        <p>Moving on towards the end of the British Empire, we have North America. The British were
                            putting harsh taxes on the American people, and this caused a revolution, one that the
                            British had not expected. While the British greatly outnumbered the American men, they still
                            lost the battle and surrendered, freeing America from the Empire. This would mark the
                            downfall of the Great British Empire.

                            To touch on World War One, the United Kingdom was a strong and crucial Allied power in the
                            war, who fought vigilantly against the Central Powers. The Central Powers included Germany,
                            Austria-Hungary, and The Ottoman Empire. The U.K.’s military was not very large, at least
                            compared to the others, but they were funded immensely, and handled the forefront of attacks
                            from Germany and Austria. Lastly, when it comes to World War II, the UK was once again
                            allied with the United States and many others against Germany, Japan, and others. They
                            fought expertly and ended up winning the war.
