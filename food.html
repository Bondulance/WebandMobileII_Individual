                        <p>While contrary to popular belief, you are going to need food to survive your trip to London.
                            Lucky for you, London and the entirety of the United Kingdom, have many iconic and delicious
                            meals for you to try. The first and most iconic meal, <span>Fish and chips</span>, has been
                            a staple in the English cuisine for nearly 200 years. The origin of the meal actually took
                            inspiration from outside of the United Kingdom, and from the Jewish religion. As Jews cannot
                            cook on the Sabbath or Friday night, they would prepare meals in the afternoon and fry white
                            fish in matzo meal which was the origin of the fried fish. The English took inspiration from
                            this and added some chips, or of course as we know them, french fries.

                        </div>


                        <p>But wait, that is a lunch or dinner meal, we can’t have that for breakfast! You caught me, I
                            guess we can’t have any breakfast… BOOM a full <span>english breakfast</span> right in front
                            of your face. This tasty and personal favorite behemoth of a meal consists of strips of
                            bacon or sausages, eggs, a cup of baked beans, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, and toast. This
                            meal is guaranteed to give you all the necessary nutrients you could need to start the day,
                            and personally I find this meal to be much better than the American breakfast. Hot take,
                            talk to a wall, embrace it and put some beans on toast.


                            <br><br>
                            Another lovely meal for you to indulge in is the <span>Sunday roast</span>. This is a
                            traditional dish for London and all of the United Kingdom, consisting of a roasted meat,
                            roasted potatoes, and other side dishes like a Yorkshire pudding, gravy, stuffing, and
                            usually some sort of condiments like Horseradish sauce or mustard. This classic meal came
                            from the British Isles, and it would be eaten after church on Sunday afternoon or evening.
                            Surprisingly, this meal was only done by the Isles for a good amount of time since its
                            creation, only finally spreading to mainland United Kingdom nearly 50 years after its
                            documented creation.

                        <p>
                            Lastly, we have discussed a hearty breakfast, a delicious lunch with fish and chips, and a
                            lovely dinner with our Sunday roast. Let’s talk about London’s most infamous dessert, the
                            <span>Sticky toffee pudding</span>. Sticky toffee pudding is an extremely iconic meal in
                            London, made out of a moist sponge cake, toffee sauce, and usually has some sort of custard
                            or ice cream over top of the cake. Now the origins of this dessert are quite split. There
                            are many people that claim to have invented it, some being owners of pubs in 1907! Overall,
                            London has many fantastic and iconic meals for you to try out on your visit. Many of my
                            favorites were mentioned, and I highly recommend all of these. Quickly, when it comes to
                            restaurants, London is kind of like New York City, where it is a big melting pot of
                            cultures, so there are many other foods from different cultures, and a lot of them are
                            fantastic. Definitely give all of them a chance, the city has amazing options.
